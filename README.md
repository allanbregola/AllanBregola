# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Allan Bregola

**Senior Clinical Research Practitioner and Lead** | ICH-GCP Accredited | Learning solutions for Research and Clinical Trial Delivery

About me:

I am a clinical professional, doing research on my daily basis for the past 15 years.
I lead the clinical research portfolio and delivery team at a busy NHS Community Healthcare Trust in London (> 3 million patients a year). 
Experienced in recruiting myself over **1,500 participants** across diverse and vulnerable populations and clinical specialities.  
Currently developing skills in **Python**, **R**, **Power BI**, and **machine learning** to find solutions for daily challenges in clinical research delivery.  
My interests include working with high-complex RCTs, including drug trials and medical device trials, as well as fast site set-up and successful study delivery.  
Only research can advance science and improve lives, so my contribution to the world is to do my best to disseminate study participation opportunities.
